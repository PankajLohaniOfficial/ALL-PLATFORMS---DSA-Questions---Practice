## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove the duplicates **in-place** such that each unique element appears only once.  
The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Return the number of unique elements in `nums`.  
The first `k` elements of `nums` should contain the final result.

## ðŸ”¹ Example 1

**Input**
nums = [1,1,2]

**Output**
2, nums = [1,2,_]

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 2

**Input**
nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]

**Output**
5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,,,,,_]

---

## âœ… Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing order**

---

## ðŸ’¡ Approach

We use the **two-pointer technique**:

- One pointer (`i`) keeps track of the last unique element.
- The other pointer (`j`) scans through the array.
- When a new unique element is found, it is placed at the correct position.
- At the end, `i + 1` gives the number of unique elements.

This ensures:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
